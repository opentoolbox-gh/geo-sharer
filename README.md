# Geo Sharer

Geo Sharer is a React Native application that allows users to get their address with an accuracy of +/- 5 meters. This application is perfect for those who need precise location information quickly and easily.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Running the Application

#### 1. Start the Metro Server

Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native, needs to be running for the application to work. Start Metro by running the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

#### 2. Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

- For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

- For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly.

#### 3. Modifying your App

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. Press the R key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu to see your changes!
